  <h1 align="center">Better Shuffle</h1>
  <p align="center">
  Open-source algorithm for shuffling that is completely random, rather than the curated one that Spotify offers. I created this with the realization that most of the songs in any given playlist would never be played back to me through shuffle, but rather only a small handful would consistenly play. The application interacts with the Spotify API to retrieve all the necessary data to make sure you are able to experience a better way to shuffle music.
